<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I live in Pasay, Philippines, where it’s busy and full of life. I used to play video games a lot, spending hours on
  them, but now I just watch random videos online. I like stuff like tech videos or funny clips. I also work on projects
  to get better at things I’m learning. Pasay is my home, and even with all the noise and traffic, I like it here—it
  keeps me going.</p>

<p>Right now, I’m into web development. I’m taking a course to learn how to make websites, and it’s pretty cool. I
  practice by building small projects, like making pages or fixing code. My latest idea is a website about the
  fundamentals of math, but I want it to be graphically intense—like those colorful, eye-catching designs with cool
  animations and bold visuals. I think it could make learning math fun and keep people interested longer, maybe with 3D
  shapes or interactive graphs that pop off the screen.</p>

<p>I don’t have many hobbies left to talk about, but I still keep busy. Sometimes I think about new ideas, like adding
  quizzes or games to that math website to make it even more exciting. I also listen to music when I work, usually pop
  rock songs like "Iris" by Goo Goo Dolls, "Far Away" by Nickelback, and "Scotty Doesn’t Know" by Lustra, because they
  keep me in a good mood. I’m just trying to improve myself and see where this web development thing takes me—maybe I’ll
  create something that helps students love math as much as I’m starting to love coding!</p>
